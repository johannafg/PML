# Practical Machine Learning Quiz
Practical machine learning test
# Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We may use any of the other variables to predict with. We should create a report describing how we built your model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices you did. We also use our prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
